TestRunner:
* clear() method, or better callbacks for timeouts
* SecurityManager: disallow access to files/sockets/etc
	for everything in whatever package I put student code into
* Nice way to configure:
  - time to wait for timeouts
  - name of package to put student code
  - ?
* ResultsWidget:
  - link to a panel for stdout/stderr results
    > truncate to a certain number of lines
    > maybe have a scrollable "more" option
  - link to the exception for a failure 
* TestResult
  - pass
  - failed assertion
  - failure with exception
    > store type of exception/stack trace
  - timeout
  - security exception
* Scrollable main panel
* User accounts
* problem creation workflow
* Jython support
  - compile Jython in-memory?
